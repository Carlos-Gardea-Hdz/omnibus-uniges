 * Transport object returned by ProvisionDemoSessionAction (slice 006).
 *
 * It carries the freshly minted, demo-tagged User together with the session tag
 * the Action assigned and the preset it provisioned. The HTTP layer consumes it
 * to log the user in and seed the session flags — keeping the Action free of
 * Illuminate\Http (it returns this VO instead of touching Auth/session), exactly
 * as AuthenticateUserAction returns a User.
 *
 * Not marked #[TypeScript]: it is server-only and the demo_session_id it holds is
 * the isolation token, which must never reach the client. Carrying an Eloquent
 * model as a transport between Action and controller is acceptable here — the VO
 * is never persisted.
